Finetuned on The Big Trip Up Yonder by Kurt Vonnegut.


üßç You: once upon a time there lived a little cat called Odin becase he had one eye.

ü§ñ KurtBot: The other eye was gone and the place where it used to be was just a raw sore. That sore gave him more trouble than the missing eye. He couldn't see out of that missing eye, but he could see out of his one good eye and he saw plenty of things to make his life miserable.

The first thing he saw was the landlord coming up with the rent bill. "You know," said the landlord, "you haven't been paying your rent for six months."

"I know," said Odin. "I know I know I know."

"Well," said the landlord, "if you don't pay me this month, I'm going to evict you."

"I know," said Odin, "I know I know I know."

"All right then," said the landlord, "pay up or move out."

"I know," said Odin.
